Music experimentation using Haskell's Euterpea Library
------------------------------------------------------

After looking  through Haskell School of  Music¹ by Hudak² and Quick³,  I found
myself playing  a little bit  with the  subject matter again.  Nothing original
mind you, I am  missing the talent for that sort of endeavour.  I did find some
sheet music of Avril 14, a song⁴ off  of the 2001 druKQs album⁵ by Aphex Twin⁶,
however. Unfortunately I can't remember where I  got the sheet. So I can't pro-
perly attribute the person. I changed a couple of things, but nothing major. If
you know the song, you'll recognise it I am sure.

To give it a go you need  this repository, and recursively: I adjusted the ori-
ginal Euterpea code  to play nice with modern Cabal  installations. Then on the
top-level there  is stack setup to  orchestrate everything. You'll also  need a
synthesizer on  your system to perform  the actual playback. On  Linux systems,
‘fluidsynth’ works.

With that in mind, here's a quick-start:

    % fluidsynth &
    % git clone --recursive https://github.com/ft/music
    % cd music
    % stack run
